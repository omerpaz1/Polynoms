# Polynoms

Polynom is a program that can do several actions on Polynom type functions. Poynom uses the Class
Monom which has been predefined with several functions.
The program uses an imported project, named Graph This project is to print function graphs as well as points, lines ... The project is located in the Graph folder.
The tests of the function were carried out by Junit, all the functions have their verifications which are validated. The tests are located in the Tests folder.

# The Polynom us to perform several actions on a Polynom function :

```
 Derivate
 Add (Several uses)
 Multiply
 Subtract
 Equal two Polynom
 Area under the x-axis
 Area above the x-axis
 Intersection points of the curve with the x-axis
 Calculate the Max and Min points
```

# Built With

Eclipse - is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, and is the most widely used Java IDE

# Getting Started

There is a test object that contains demonstrations of all functions to illustrate how things work. In addition, it is recommended to go over the javadoc before and read on all functions.
